Work-in-progress: An attempt at a Pokemon battle emulator.

## Development

To compile / build from source, you'll want to download and
install [Bazel](https://bazel.io/versions/master/docs/install.html).

Then, try something like the following (from the `src` directory):

```
$ bazel build //main/java/...
$ bazel test //test/java/
```

TODO(jbrown1618): How to run/test the UI.
